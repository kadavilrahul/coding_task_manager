Create a README.md file following this exact structure and style. 
The README must be practical, precise, and include working installation commands that don't miss any steps.

## REQUIRED STRUCTURE:

1. **Title**: Single line with project name
2. **One-line description**: Clear, concise explanation of what the project does
3. **Features section**: Bullet points highlighting key capabilities
4. **Installation section**: This section combines installation and usage. It should include:
    - **Prerequisites/System Requirements**: Specific OS versions, dependencies, and system requirements.
    - **Installation Steps**: Step-by-step commands that actually work, using serial numbers and proper bash code blocks.
    - **Usage Examples if any**: Clear examples with actual commands, using serial numbers and proper bash code blocks.
5. **File organization**: Brief description of main files
6. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
7. **Additional sections as needed**: Configuration, contributing, license

## STYLE REQUIREMENTS:

**Code Blocks:**
- Use proper bash code blocks with ```bash for all commands.
- Provide complete, copy-pastable commands.
- Include all necessary steps (no assumptions).
- Test commands work on specified OS versions.
- Include setup scripts when beneficial.
- Provide alternative installation methods when applicable.

**Descriptions:**
- Keep descriptions practical and focused
- Avoid marketing language
- Include specific version numbers and OS compatibility
- Mention tested environments explicitly

**Code Examples:**
- Show real, working examples
- Include actual file paths and directory structures
- Provide complete command sequences
- Include error handling and troubleshooting steps

**Prerequisites:**
- List exact package names for installation.
- Include version requirements.
- Specify OS compatibility clearly.
- Mention any GUI or special requirements.

## MANDATORY ELEMENTS:

1. **Working Getting Started Section**: Every command must be tested and functional, covering both installation and initial usage.
2. **No Missing Steps**: Include environment setup, dependency installation, configuration, and initial usage commands.
3. **Error Prevention**: Address common installation issues proactively
4. **Multiple OS Support**: Provide instructions for different systems when applicable
5. **Verification Steps**: Include commands to verify successful installation
6. **File Structure**: Explain what files do and where they're located

## EXAMPLES OF GOOD PRACTICES FROM MY STYLE:

- Use setup scripts for complex installations
- Provide both quick setup and manual installation options
- Include specific file paths and directory structures
- Add troubleshooting sections with actual solutions
- Mention tested environments explicitly
- Include backup and restore procedures when relevant
- Provide cron job examples for automation
- Include verification commands to check if installation worked

## AVOID:
- Vague instructions like "install dependencies"
- Missing intermediate steps
- Untested command sequences
- Generic troubleshooting advice
- Assumptions about user's system setup

Generate a README that someone can follow step-by-step without any prior knowledge and successfully install/use the project on the first try.
