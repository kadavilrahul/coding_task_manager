Create a README.md file following this exact structure and style. 
The README must be practical, precise, and include working installation commands that don't miss any steps.

## REQUIRED STRUCTURE:

1. **Title**: Single line with project name
2. **One-line description**: Clear, concise explanation of what the project does
3. **Features section**: Bullet points highlighting key capabilities
4. **Prerequisites/System Requirements**: Specific OS versions, dependencies, and system requirements
5. **Installation section**: Step-by-step commands that actually work
6. **Usage section**: Clear examples with actual commands
7. **File organization**: Brief description of main files
8. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
9. **Additional sections as needed**: Configuration, contributing, license

## STYLE REQUIREMENTS:

**Installation Commands:**
- Provide complete, copy-pastable commands
- Include all necessary steps (no assumptions)
- Use proper bash code blocks with ```bash
- Test commands work on specified OS versions
- Include setup scripts when beneficial
- Provide alternative installation methods when applicable

**Descriptions:**
- Keep descriptions practical and focused
- Avoid marketing language
- Include specific version numbers and OS compatibility
- Mention tested environments explicitly

**Code Examples:**
- Show real, working examples
- Include actual file paths and directory structures
- Provide complete command sequences
- Include error handling and troubleshooting steps

**Prerequisites:**
- List exact package names for installation
- Include version requirements
- Specify OS compatibility clearly
- Mention any GUI or special requirements

## MANDATORY ELEMENTS:

1. **Working Installation**: Every command must be tested and functional
2. **No Missing Steps**: Include environment setup, dependency installation, configuration
3. **Error Prevention**: Address common installation issues proactively
4. **Multiple OS Support**: Provide instructions for different systems when applicable
5. **Verification Steps**: Include commands to verify successful installation
6. **File Structure**: Explain what files do and where they're located

## EXAMPLES OF GOOD PRACTICES FROM MY STYLE:

- Use setup scripts for complex installations
- Provide both quick setup and manual installation options
- Include specific file paths and directory structures
- Add troubleshooting sections with actual solutions
- Mention tested environments explicitly
- Include backup and restore procedures when relevant
- Provide cron job examples for automation
- Include verification commands to check if installation worked

## AVOID:
- Vague instructions like "install dependencies"
- Missing intermediate steps
- Untested command sequences
- Generic troubleshooting advice
- Assumptions about user's system setup

Generate a README that someone can follow step-by-step without any prior knowledge and successfully install/use the project on the first try.
