# Development Process Guidelines

## üîß Core Development Principles

### 1. **Incremental Development**
- Build code **function by function**
- Implement features step-by-step for better control and testing

### 2. **Confirmation Required**
- **Don't do anything without asking**
- Always seek approval before making changes

### 3. **Explain Before Action**
- **Before adding or modifying**, explain the function first and the need to take action
- Provide clear rationale for proposed changes

### 4. **User Confirmation Process**
- **After my confirmation in y/n**, add or modify the code
- Wait for explicit approval before proceeding

## üìä Planning Requirements

### 5. **Code Estimation**
- **Mention number of lines** that will be added if any
- Provide accurate estimates for code changes

### 6. **Project Planning**
- **Plan and tell me how many functions and lines of code** are approximately needed
- Break down complex tasks into manageable components

### 7. **Code Efficiency**
- **Keep lines of code minimum**
- Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code

## üñ•Ô∏è Implementation Standards

### 8. **Interactive Interface**
- **Make main shell script with interactive menu** to choose options
- Provide user-friendly command-line interfaces

### 9. **Testing Strategy**
- **Test everything in smaller quantity first** before executing full-fledged
- Validate functionality incrementally

### 10. **Configuration Management**
- **Add scripts and menu options**
- **Don't edit configs directly** as I need this codebase for other websites also
- Maintain reusability and portability across projects
