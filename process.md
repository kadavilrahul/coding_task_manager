Build code funtion by function
Don't do anything without asking
Before adding or modifying explain the function first and the need to take action
After my confirmation in y/n add or modify it
Mention number of lines that will be added if any
Plan and tell me how many functions and lines of code are approximately needed
Keep lines of code minimum
Make main shell script with interactive menu to choose options
Test everything in smaller quantity first before executing full fledged
Add scripts and menu options. Don't edit configs directly as I need this codebase for other websites also
